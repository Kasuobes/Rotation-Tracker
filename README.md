Armored Warfare PvE Mission Rotation Tracker v2 by Haswell & Wiser Guy

This program requires no installation, but it does create small text files in the folder it is located in to store data 
such as the missions on rotation, window position, and time offset.

If any new missions are added, you can add them by editing the Missions.txt file.
Each mission must be separated into its own line with the "Enter" key.

If the Missions.txt file is deleted, this program will automatically create a new one with all 37 PvE missions as of the 0.27 update of Armored Warfare.

This project is forked from the original Armored Warfare PvE Mission Rotation Tracker v1.01 and v1.05 by Wiser Guy.
